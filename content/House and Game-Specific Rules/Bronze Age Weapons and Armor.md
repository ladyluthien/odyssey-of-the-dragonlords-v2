Steel has not yet made its way to Thylea. As a result, most weapons and armor are made of bronze, although mithril and adamantine can be worked. Bronze equipment is half again as heavy as regular equipment, and costs 75% of the listed costs. In addition, any armor Strength requirements are increased by 1. 

Bronze cannot be made into chainmail. Sorry. 
#### Cultural Weapons
The labrys and khopesh are available. In addition, Thyleans sometimes use a doru (plural dorata), a large spear with a spike on the end. A pair of these spears symbolizes military might. 

Doru | 75gp | 6lbs | Dual-wielding (back end is a dagger), thrown (10/30), parrying | 1d8 slashing/1d4 piercing
