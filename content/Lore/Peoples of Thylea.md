Thylea is home to many different races, only some of whom are native to her shores. Thyleans are collectively referred to as mortalsâ€”even those with very long lifespans. 
#### Native Races
 - _**Centaurs, [[Satyr|Satyrs]] and [[Merfolk|Sirens]]**_ - These creatures have existed in Thylea for thousands of years. They are common in rural areas but somewhat rare in cities.  
 - _**Gygans**_ - The gygans are a race of ancient cyclops that were mostly exterminated during the First War.  
 - _**Medusae**_ - Medusae are the remnants of those who have been cursed by dark powers. They are secretive and very rare.  
 - _**[[Minotaur|Minotaurs]]**_ - Minotaurs are cursed tribes of humans. They are usually treated very poorly in cities.  
#### Settler Races
- _**[[Human|Humans]]**_ - Humans are plentiful. Some were shipwrecked here thousands of years ago, and others came over with the Dragonlords 500 years ago. Humans populate all major cities and settlements.  
- _**[[Elf|Elves]], [[Dwarf|Dwarves]], [[Gnome|Gnomes]], [[Halfling|Halflings]]**_ - These races are less common than humans, but they populate all major cities and settlements in fair numbers.
- **[[Planetouched|Demigods]]** - Some mortals have divine heritage, either godly or from a Titan. Those with Titan heritage are usually called Stygians, rather than demigods, and are often mistrusted.
