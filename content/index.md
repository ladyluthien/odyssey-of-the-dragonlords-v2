title: Welcome to Odyssey of the Dragonlords
---

This is the player's guide for *Odyssey of the Dragonlords: Level Up Edition.* It is a one-stop repository for lore; character options; house rules; and anything else you might need to refer to quickly. 

To navigate, use the menu at the left-hand side of your screen. 

## Where to Start
Lost? Follow this list:
- First, check out the broad strokes of the lore by learning [[About Thylea]] and reading the [[Laws of Thylea]]. 
- Character creation can go in any order, but you need a Heritage, a Background, a Culture, a Destiny, and a Class (plus possibly an Archetype, depending on when your class gets one). Check out [[Additional Cultures and Backgrounds]] for a handful of really campaign-flavored options if you like. 
	- Are you affiliated with one of the [[Factions of Thylea]]? 
	- Do you feel a tie to one of the Mortal Kingdoms?
	- Do you have a connection to the mythic [[Dragonlords]]?
- Make sure you read about [[Bronze Age Weapons and Armor]] and [[Fame]].
- Skim the [[Miscellaneous House Rules]]. They're short.
## General Notes
- **This site is the universal repository for stuff.** I've tweaked a couple of things, included third-party stuff, and generally gone ham curating a cohesive set of options for taking TTRPG fantasy to Ancient Greece. I don't think you'll be starved for choice, but if you see something elsewhere that you *really* want to play, ask me.
- There is a *lot* of third-party stuff. If something turns out to be wildly unbalanced in play, I reserve the right to edit it. 
- Rather than providing suggested cultures for each heritage, I provide suggested Destinies. This is to better establish a heroic, Homeric mode of play, where one's fate from birth often outweighs any effects of how one is raised (see Oedipus' fate, for example). 
- If you select the [[Prophecy]] destiny, it ties you to an Epic Path which ties you *much* more closely to the story of the adventure. [[Revenge]] and [[Return to Glory]] have optional Epic Paths as well. 
- I'm still a little mystified by tables in Obsidian, so some tables are more...suggestions of tables. Hopefully they're all legible. 
- There are some additional spells in this module, including the *bond of the dragonlords* and *oath of the dragonlords* ones that are very important, but those are going to live in Roll20 because I have copy-pasted so much. So much.
