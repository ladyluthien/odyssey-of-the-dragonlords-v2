The Fame system functions like Prestige, with a Thylean-specific series of outcomes. 

![[Pasted image 20240819125325.png]]To make a Fame/Prestige check or call in a favor other than those detailed in this table, roll 1d20 and add 1/4 of your current fame score (minimum 1). If you are new to an area or otherwise would be unfamiliar to it, you roll with disadvantage. The DC remains calculated the same (12 plus twice the region level), but various prejudices, situations, etc., can impact that DC up to 4 in either direction.

Where an ability would grant you Prestige, it instead grants you an equal amount of Fame. This helps balance against Prestige-stacking, which RAW is pretty easy to do. The shrines you gain at level 15 are not automatically Strongholds, but could be converted with the appropriate gold expenditure. 

At Narrator discretion, you may get a secret/plot hook/hint instead of a gift or a magic item.
