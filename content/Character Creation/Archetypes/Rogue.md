### Odyssean
Odysseans are legendary tricksters who at first glance seem like common soldiers. They carry spears and shields like any rank-and-file hoplite, but rather than moving in strict formations or honing their discipline, Odysseans hone their minds. When two armies smash together, shields bursting under the strain of a perfect phalanx, the Odyssean is the soldier who stands back and searches for weaknesses in the enemy’s defenses. Even when badly outnumbered, they may find a way to exploit conditions on the battlefield to turn the tide in the favor of their allies. Soldiers who exhibit such a sharp mind quickly grow in notoriety and fame, but being famed for your cleverness is a double-edged sword. Odysseans are often drawn into conflicts that take them far from home, where monsters and other dangers are a constant threat. Such harrowing odysseys are the namesake of the Odyssean, who may be forced to survive several such journeys in their lifetime. As an Odyssean rogue, you have a quick mind and you can intuit the strengths of your companions. You enjoy using your intelligence to trick your enemies and impress your friends. However, you know that you must never let your mind grow dull, for when the time comes that you are again flung into the wilderness, it will be your wits alone that save you from a gruesome death. 
#### Vagrant Soldier 
Despite your roguish demeanor, you have all the training of a common soldier. When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with shields. Additionally, spears and tridents count as finesse weapons for you. 
#### Clever as the Gods 
Starting at 3rd level, you are rarely outwitted on the field of battle. On your turn, you may use your bonus action to devise a clever plan to trick an enemy. Choose one creature that you can see. Make a Deception check contested by that creature’s Insight check. If you win the contest, you and your allies have advantage on attacks against that creature until the beginning of your next turn. This feature cannot be used on the same creature more than once per combat encounter. 
#### Notorious Trickster 
Starting at 9th level, you are famed for your cleverness, to the point where intelligent enemies are extremely wary of you. Creatures who are aware of your presence but cannot see you become too distracted to perform opportunity attacks until they can see you again. Additionally, when you hit a creature with a Sneak Attack, if that creature is concentrating on a spell, they have disadvantage on the roll to maintain concentration. 
#### Tenacious Survivor 
At 13th level, you’ve survived through so many ordeals that you face each new challenge with grim determination. You can add your Charisma bonus to your initiative rolls. Also, at the beginning of your first turn in combat, you may use a bonus action to take a deep breath and regain hit points equal to your rogue level. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. 
#### Legendary Cunning 
Starting at 17th level, you are able to instantly assess every opportunity to seize the upper hand in combat. Whenever any of your allies makes an opportunity attack against a creature, you may choose to make a ranged attack against that same creature with advantage.

### Sacred Agent
A cult uncovered by a spy. A powerful necromancer felled by a dark, silent blade. A holy relic stolen in the dead of night. Hidden guardians blended with crowds of innocents to protect them from equally hidden threats. These actions are the domain of a sacred agent, carrying the will of their faith or cause into the shadows. The very existence of these specialized operatives is often secret. Indeed, they are often referred to euphemistically as “the hand of purpose” or even “the hand of” whatever figure or institution they serve (if they are mentioned at all). Sacred agents have no love for the gleaming armaments and colorful banners of other divine servants which would draw undue attention to their actions. Although acquainted with the dark they have no fear of the light; in urban settings they often operate in broad daylight, using crowds and tall structures to enhance their mobility and elude detection.
#### Arsenal of the Hidden
At level 3 when you select this archetype, you acquire the means to eliminate targets quietly and with a minimum amount of fuss. You gain proficiency with the assassin’s gauntlet and garrote.
#### Spellcasting
Also at 3rd level, your connection to the divine grants you the power to cast spells. Sacred agents learn magic as a tool to fight their hidden battles, tapping into the same types of divine power wielded by clerics and heralds, but with an eye toward covert action.
##### Cantrips
At 3rd level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the divine, movement, or obscurement schools. These spells count as rogue spells for you. You learn an additional cantrip at 10th level.
##### Spell Slots
You are a tertiary caster (to save my copy-pasting and table-writing, use one of the existing tertiary caster tables, such as the Wildborn Ranger (https://a5e.tools/node/3755). To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
##### Spells Known of 1st-Level or Higher
You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the divine, movement, or obscurement schools. The Spells Known column of the tertiary caster table shows when you learn more spells of your choice from this feature. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells you know from this feature and replace it with another qualifying spell of a level for which you have spell slots.
##### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
#### Mask of Anonymity
Also at level 3, you become supernaturally difficult to remember. You gain proficiency in Stealth; if you are already proficient, you instead gain an expertise die on Stealth checks. You also gain the Stealth specialty anonymity. Your maximum expertise die size for Stealth is d12 for you, rather than the usual limit of a d8.

As long as you make even a cursory effort to conceal your appearance (such as by wearing a hood, covering your lower face with a scarf, or wearing a domino mask), the memory of those who  observe you will fixate on the concealing item rather than your actual facial features and dress. Those with a reason to remember identifying details about you must make an opposed Intelligence check at disadvantage against your passive Wisdom (Stealth) to recall useful information about you.

In addition, you learn to blend seamlessly into crowds. You gain an expertise die to Stealth while in crowds, and those attempting to pick you out from those around you do so with disadvantage.
#### Crowd Fighter
At level 9, you have learned how to flow through crowds like a fish through water. You no longer treat the Crowd encounter element as difficult terrain, and while you fight in a Crowd you do not risk hitting a bystander or provoking the crowd.
#### Supernatural Athlete
Also at level 9, the city’s steep walls and high rooftops are no longer any obstacle to you. You gain a Climb speed equal to your walking speed, and you may scale even sheer surfaces as long as you keep at least one hand and one foot in contact with the surface at all times. You also learn the *feather fall* spell and may use it at will without expending a spell slot.

While falling, Acrobatics checks you make to aim for a specific landing spot are made at advantage. If you land in sufficiently loose and concealing material (such as a cart full of hay or a body of water), you can make a Stealth check to hide yourself as you land (no action required).
#### Supernatural Awareness
At level 13, you can use magic to enhance your senses. As a bonus action, you can spend spell slots to gain any of the following effects for one minute:
- 1st-level spell slot: You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. This darkvision treats magical darkness as nonmagical darkness. If you already have darkvision, its range is extended by 60 feet, but you are still only able to see through magical darkness up to 60 feet. This effect may be activated multiple times, extending the range of both effects by 30 feet for each use after the first.
- 2nd-level spell slot: you gain blindsense in a 20-foot radius around you.
- 3rd-level spell slot: you gain tremorsense in a 40-foot radius around you.

You may use a higher-level spell slot for a lower-level effect if you wish. You may also have any number of these effects active at once, and may activate any number as part of the same bonus action, but you must pay for them all individually.
#### Judge in the Shadows
At 17th level, you become an implacable figure of judgment. You are under a continuous *detect thoughts* effect with a range of 10 feet (it emits no magical aura). You may teleport a distance of up to your walking speed as a bonus action once per round.

Additionally, creatures you kill have their souls immediately sent to their final judgment. This prevents *speak with dead* from working on their remains, prevents the remains from being reanimated as an Undead creature, and their remains acquire the doomed condition. The soul
of a creature slain by you cannot be captured on its way to judgment by any means short of an artifact or the *wish* spell.
