For millennia before the coming of the Dragonlords, outsiders would occasionally wash up on the shores of Thylea. These were usually shipwrecked explorers or merchants who were blown far off course. Of all races and nationalities, these people had to live in harmony with the natives of Thylea. They formed tribes and lived on the islands of the Cerulean Gulf. When the [[Dragonlords]] came, these tribes fought with the natives of Thylea against the newcomers. In present times the barbarians are still looked upon with fear and distrust by the civilized races. They are seen as being as dangerous as the centaur tribes or fey creatures of the Oldwood. The most feared of the barbarian tribes are the Amazons that dwell upon the island of Themis.
