***Note.*** Optionally, you can choose the epic path below. If you do so, you gain inspiration when you complete your Heroic Tasks, *even if you had inspiration already*. This is the only way to have two inspiration at a time. Rather than fulfilling your destiny, you gain the Divine Blessing when you complete your Heroic Tasks, although you can still earn inspiration from your destiny source and spend it using your inspiration source. However, the Epic Path ties you to a very specific story, which may or may not be desirable.

### The Dragonslayer

You have a tragic past. Something terrible happened to you when you were young, and it forced you to reckon with the darkness within much sooner than anyone should ever have to. This tragic event shaped your identity and drove you to become who you are today. You know that it was a dragon who was responsible for destroying your childhood. The dragon might have razed your village to the ground—or it might have ruined your life in more insidious ways while polymorphed into the shape of a man or woman. Either way, you wish to discover the identity and the location of the dragon so that you can seek it out and exact brutal vengeance upon it.

**Adventure Hook:** The Oracle knows how to find the dragon that was responsible for your tragedy. 

##### Heroic Tasks 
- To kill the dragon responsible for your tragedy. 
- To find items that are key to killing dragons. Pick one lesser and one greater magic item from this list: 
	- (Lesser) Armor of Resistance—Fire: this can be any armor type. 
	- (Lesser) Ring of Resistance—Fire: only you can attune to this ring. 
	- (Greater) Dragonslayer: can be any melee weapon. 
	- (Greater) Quiver of Elhonna: includes five arrows of slaying (dragons) or bolts of slaying (dragons). 
	- (Greater) Wand of Binding: only you can attune.
	
#### Divine Blessing 
When you complete both heroic tasks, you gain the following benefit:

***Blessing of Dragon Slaying.*** You have advantage on all attacks against creatures with the dragon type. Creatures with the dragon type have disadvantage on saving throws against your spells.
