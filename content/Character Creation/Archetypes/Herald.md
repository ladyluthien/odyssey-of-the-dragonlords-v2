### Dragonlord
Dragonlords are heralds who seek to extend their reach across the land by binding a dragon into their service. Such a task should never be undertaken lightly. Forming a true bond with a dragon requires a herald to hatch a dragon egg and raise the wyrmling from the first moment it draws breath. Raising a dragon in this way requires the herald to lay their life on the line by swearing an oath. This oath creates a reciprocal bond between the herald's soul and the soul of the dragon. 
But finding a dragon egg is no easy task either. For this reason, Dragonlords summon pseudodragon familiars and train them to seek out the perfect egg. This process may take years, and many heralds come to view the pseudodragon as a partner in the oath. When an egg is finally discovered, the herald and the pseudodragon may share an almost parental pride in the hatchling. Once the herald’s dragon is grown, its master becomes a true Dragonlord. But the herald is as much a servant to the dragon as the dragon is to its master. The two are one—their destinies are interlinked—and whatsoever pain is suffered by one is also felt by the other. 

All Dragonlords follow similar tenets.

***Respect Your Allies.*** Honor the bonds you create. If you cannot respect your friends, how can you respect a dragon?

***Improve Yourself.*** Strive always to be better than the day before.

***Seek Perfection.*** Glorify that which is good and excellent in the world, in yourself, your dragon, and others.

***Your Dragon Before The World.*** No bond - of love, fealty, family, or cause - can come before the dragon you are bonded to.

#### Pseudodragon Familiar 
At third level, you gain the *find familiar* spell. When you cast the *find familiar* spell, you summon a pseudodragon instead of one of the normal forms described in the spell. The pseudodragon's primary purpose is to find you a dragon egg. The pseudodragon can smell dragon eggs if they are within one mile. The pseudodragon is likely to find a dragon egg by the time you are 5th level, but it might be earlier. If your pseudodragon hasn’t found a dragon egg by 6th level, then it departs in search of one. In 3d6 days, the pseudodragon returns to you with a dragon egg of your choice from this list: brass, bronze, copper, or silver. If at any time your dragon egg is lost or destroyed, your pseudodragon will depart in search of another one. It will return in 3d6 days with the lost egg or a suitable replacement. If you deliberately lose or destroy your egg, then your pseudodragon refuses to perform this service. 
### Channel Divinity 
Also when you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. 
##### Dragon’s Wrath
As an action, you can mimic the frightful presence of a dragon, using your Channel Divinity. You issue a roar as loud as an adult dragon. Each creature of your choice that is within 60 ft. of you and aware of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
##### Scorn the Unworthy
Your dragonlord oath elevates you above the multitudes of the corrupt and the weak. As an action, you can intone the Oath of the [[Dragonlords]], using your Channel Divinity. Enemy creatures within 30 feet that are Large or smaller in size must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls prone and loses concentration on any spells. 
#### Dragonlord’s Bond 
At 7th level, your dragon egg will hatch. You must cast the spell *bond of the dragonlords* while touching the newborn wyrmling within 24 hours of it hatching. The dragon wyrmling is now bonded to you. Additionally, you may cast the spells *bond of the dragonlords* and *dirge of the dragonlords*, and they require no material components when you cast them. Your wyrmling has hit points equal to 40 + twice your paladin level, and it adds your proficiency bonus to its saving throws. 
#### Young Dragon 
By 15th level, your dragon grows into a young dragon of the appropriate type if five years have not yet passed since its hatching. The dragon will now allow itself to be used as a mount. In addition, while mounted on a dragon, you gain that dragon’s damage resistances, damage immunities, and senses (blindsight, darkvision, and its passive Perception if it is greater than yours). 
#### Unbreakable Bond 
By 20th level, you and your dragon have learned to fight in unison on the battlefield. Your dragon gains access to its Multiattack feature, and its breath weapon now recharges using the normal rules each round instead of using the restriction outlined in *bond of the dragonlords*. Additionally, when your dragon fails a saving throw, you may choose to have it succeed instead. This ability recharges after you and the dragon complete a long rest.

### Gloryseeker
Gloryseekers are those heralds dedicated to achieving personal fame and glory. Some are questing knights errant riding out to slay dragons, fight blackguards on bridges, or
rendezvous with green giants (note: probably not in this module, though). Others are doomed godsworn warriors heartily throwing themselves into danger that in glorious death in battle they might achieve their preferred afterlife. Still others are those born to glory, descendants of
gods waging war, slaying monsters, and becoming kings. And some are simply vain, power hungry narcissists seeking to “cheat” death by achieving immortality through memory.

All gloryseekers follow similar tenets.

***Death or Glory.*** You must be willing to put everything on the line. A death in glory is better than a life in shame.

***My Name will Live On.*** You must craft a legacy for yourself, not only performing great deeds but ensuring those deeds are known, and your fame will outlive you.

***Beneath You.*** Do not sully yourself with mundane and ordinary tasks, except where absolutely necessary.

***Eternal Drive.*** Never be satisfied, and do not rest on your laurels. Always strive to better yourself and seek out new accomplishments.
#### Archetype School
Add spells of the Enhancement school to your list of herald spells.
#### Channel Divinity
At 3rd level you gain the following channel divinity options:
##### Heroic Attack
As a bonus action, you can grant yourself the ability to critically hit on a 19-20 with all weapon attacks. If you would already critically hit on better than a natural 20 you increase the range by 1, to a maximum of 17-20. This lasts for one minute.
##### Peerless
As an action you can grant yourself unmatched skill. For the next 10 minutes you may add your Charisma modifier to all ability checks.
#### Driven by Success
At 7th level you gain the following benefits whenever you score a critical hit:
- Inspiration if you do not already have it, and
- 1d10 x your proficiency bonus in temporary hit points.
#### No Guts, No Glory
At 15th level the thrill of danger drives you to new heights. While bloodied can grant yourself advantage on weapon attack rolls until the start of your next turn. If you do so, all attack rolls against you have advantage for the same duration. Also while bloodied your chance to critically hit
with weapon attacks is 19-20. If you already critically hit on better than a natural 20 you instead increase your critical hit range by 1 to a maximum of 17-20.

In addition, if you die all allies within 60 feet that see you fall gain inspiration.
#### Living Legend
At 20th level your movement speed increases by 5 feet, your carry weight is doubled, you gain proficiency with an additional 2 skills of your choice, and your high and long jump distances both increase by a number of feet equal to your Charisma modifier.

In addition, you and your party have advantage on Prestige checks.

### Holy Champion

### Liberator
Heralds that bear the message of freedom, liberators dedicate their lives to fighting against oppression and tyranny. They are the terror of slavers and the breakers of chains. Most of
these heralds are solitary, but they have been known to form groups to fight against particularly powerful or numerous oppressors.

#### Tenets of the Liberator
All liberators hold similar tenets, regardless of any master they serve.

***Break Chains.*** Whether literal or metaphorical, free the innocent from the things that imprison them.

***Destroy Oppression.*** Individual agents of oppression may be shown mercy, but oppressive leaders and systems may not. Tear down cruelty and corruption wherever you can find it. Destroy them utterly, and do not allow new oppressors to take their place.

***Pragmatism.*** Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Sometimes compromises must be made for the sake of the greater good.

***Equality.*** Freedom is for everyone, not just a select group of people. The only exceptions are those who would use their own freedom to deny it to others.

***Justice.*** Brutal chaos where the strong dominate the weak is no freedom at all.
#### Archetype School
Add the movement school of magic to your list of herald spells.
#### Channel Divinity
At 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.
##### Chainbreaker
As an action you can destroy all non-magical restraints in a 30 foot radius of yourself. Chains shatter, ropes untie, shackles break, cell doors crumble into rotted heaps, window bars snap off, etc. None of the restraints destroyed this way will ever work again, and attempting to reuse the materials in new restraints leaves them brittle and easily broken.
##### Mind Clearer
As a bonus action, select a number of creatures within 60 feet of you up to your proficiency
bonus. If a chosen creature is blinded, charmed, confused, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, slowed, or stunned, those conditions immediately end. In addition, if the creature is dominated or supernaturally compelled in some way, those effects also end.
#### Gatecrasher
Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the Adamant Mountain combat tradition and all weapons you wield are considered to have the Breaker property.
#### Bane of Slavers
At 7th level, your Divine Smite becomes deadlier to oppressors. Choose a number of organizations up to half your proficiency bonus. Members of these organizations, plus any creature involved in the slave trade as a supplier or customer, any creature with the Evil alignment trait, and any Fiend all take an additional die of damage from your Divine Smite. You may change the chosen  organizations when you complete a long rest.
##### Wall Toppler
At 15th level, you gain a burrow speed equal to your walking speed, and may tunnel directly through worked stone as if it were ordinary earth. You always leave a tunnel behind you as you go. This ability is supernatural and does not require you to have your hands free. Liberators are fond of
using this ability to undermine the walls of prisons and strongholds belonging to tyrants.
#### Beacon of Liberty
At 20th level, you can become a shining beacon of freedom. You can use an action to shine the light of freedom so brightly that none can escape it. For one minute, you emit bright light to 100 feet and dim light for 100 feet beyond that. All creatures in the radius of your bright light are under a continuous freedom of movement effect and are immune to the stunned and petrified conditions, and if either of these conditions are present they immediately end. All restraints and imprisoning structures (even magical ones) in the area of your bright light immediately spring open. If a creature is blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or missing limbs (whether by injury or birth), those afflictions are immediately healed as if by a *regenerate* spell unless the creature does not wish for them to be. At the Narrator's discretion, other afflictions such as chronic pain, cancer, and so on are also healed.
Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.
