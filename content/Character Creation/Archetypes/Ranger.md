### Hunter
The hunter is the ranger at their most basic. They are masters of woodcraft who employ those skills tracking and hunting down their quarry. Most cut their teeth on simple prey such as beasts, but many eventually graduate to more dangerous game. Many have good reputations as monster hunters, eliminating the giants, dragons, and monstrosities that lurk in the wilds, waiting to threaten travelers or menace humanoid settlements, or bounty hunters and guardians tracking down dangerous bandits and raiders. Others have a darker edge though, being far less particular about who they hunt or why.
#### Specialized Hunter
At level 3, you can gain two studied adversaries at the end of a long rest instead of 1. When you finish a short rest you may swap one for another. Once you have done so you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.
#### Fighting Style
At 3rd level you gain one Fighting Style as per the fighter class. This fighting style must be Archery, Dueling, Great Weapon Fighting, or Two Weapon Fighting.
#### Bring Down the Quarry
At 7th level you also gain a +1 bonus to damage against your studied adversaries. This increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 15th level.
#### Peerless Tracker
At 11th level you gain a d8 expertise die on the track, scout, or hunt and gather journey activities. In addition, if tracking one of your studied adversaries the maximum size of expertise die you may gain on the check is 1d12.
#### Instinctual Defense
At level 11, your training hunting down dangerous and unique quarry has caused you to develop targeted defenses against their abilities. Choose one of the following.
##### Evasion
When you make a Dexterity saving throw against an effect that deals half damage on a success, you take no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.
##### Adaptive Defense
You have an expertise die on saving throws to avoid or escape being grappled, restrained, or knocked prone. In addition, the first time since the start of your turn that you are hit by an attack, you gain a +3 bonus to AC against any further attacks from that specific creature until the start of your next turn.
##### Innured Constitution
You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition. This has also bolstered your general constitution, granting an expertise die on all saving throws against disease.
#### Master Slayer
At 15th level, when attacking one of your studied adversaries you may increase the benefits of your trained accuracy ability as if you had expended one additional use, to a maximum equivalent of 3 uses. Once you have done so against a specific creature, you cannot do so again against that creature for 24 hours.

### Wayfarer
It seems unlikely that anyone has ever landed on a remote island, traversed an arctic tundra, or scouted a subterranean cavern that a Wayfinder has not found first. These world-class explorers are invaluable members of any expedition into unmapped lands and waters, able not only to traverse any kind of terrain and almost intuit what lies over the next horizon, but also (and perhaps more importantly) to find their wayback home when the adventure is done.
#### Explorer's Ken
At 3rd level, you have become adept at guiding others across uncharted regions. You gain proficiency with navigator’s tools, cartographer’s tools, and one type of vehicle of your choice. If you are already proficient in any of these tools, you instead gain an expertise die. In addition, you gain the Guide exploration knack, or another exploration knack if you already have it. This does not count against your total exploration knacks known.
#### Always Forward
Also at 3rd level, you are equipped to overcome any natural obstacle. You gain an expertise die when making saving throws to resist fatigue following a forced march. In addition, choose one of the following options:
##### Specialized Explorer
You gain an additional secret of nature from the druid class, and it does not count against your
total exploration knacks known.
##### World Wanderer
You gain a climbing speed and a swimming speed equal to your speed, or increase these
speeds by 10 feet if you already have them. In addition, your speed is only reduced by 5 feet
instead of halved when crawling, squeezing, or traversing difficult terrain.
#### Horizon Scanner
At 7th level, your vision has grown keen from long practice looking for subtle signs at great distances. You can see through heavily obscured areas as though they were lightly obscured, and through lightly obscured areas as though they were not obscured. If you have darkvision, this feature allows you to see in darkness as though it were bright light within the range of your
darkvision, and as though it were dim light beyond that range, although you still can only perceive shades of gray in the dark. If you do not have darkvision, this feature functionally gives you darkvision at unlimited range.

In addition, you have advantage on sight-based Perception checks, and when visibility is clear you can make out fine details at extreme ranges, discerning creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.
#### Uncanny Navigator
At 11th level, your ability to parse unfamiliar environments appears almost preternatural to others.
You always know if the surrounding terrain has been influenced or modified by magic, although you do not necessarily know how it has been changed. In addition, you always know the direction and distance of any location you have visited before, and you have advantage on ability checks made to determine the shortest path to specific, immobile locations on your current plane whose existence you are aware of, as well as to the nearest generic geographic feature of a given kind, such as a mountain, river, settlement, island, etc.
#### Early Explorer
Also at 11th level, you gain one of the options from the 19th-level Extreme Exploration feature. If you already possess the benefit you choose or gain it again later, you instead gain the following substitution:

Cold resistance -> cold immunity
Fire resistance -> fire immunity
Poison immunity -> immunity to all poisons and the poisoned condition
Climbing speed -> 10 ft faster climbing speed
Swimming speed -> 10 ft faster swimming speed
#### Lead the Way
At 15th level, others have learned to trust your example and confidently follow in your footsteps.
Whenever you succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against an effect, any of your allies who observed you gain advantage on their next saving throw against the same effect in the next 10 minutes. Likewise, whenever you succeed on an Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, Stealth, or Survival check, any allies that observed you have advantage on their next check to perform the same activity using the same skill in the next 10 minutes. This ability applies even if your check or saving throw would otherwise be considered simultaneous with that of your ally, such as when making a group ability check, or if you and an ally are both targeted by the same spell. If the check
or saving throw is simultaneous, you may also choose one ally to automatically succeed on the check or saving throw instead of gaining advantage.
