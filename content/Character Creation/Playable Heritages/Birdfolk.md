In Thylea, birdfolk are the descendants of harpies who fell in love - or lust - with mortal races. They are often mistrusted by other mortals, who stereotype them as filthy, greedy monsters with dog-like persistence. In truth, the physical characteristics of harpies seem to be dominant over those of mortals, and a birdfolk may have only the most distant relation to a harpy ancestor. While those who are truly half-mortal, half-monster sometimes find themselves battling the worst parts of themselves, the vast majority have no more inclination for or against malice than any other mortal. 

Birdfolk with true wings are often pressed into service as messengers, bound by profound oaths to not read the contents of the letters they carry. It is rare for a birdfolk to be trusted enough to deliver a verbal message.
