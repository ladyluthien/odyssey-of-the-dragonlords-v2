In general, I trust you to use your best judgement to select cultures and backgrounds that fit the world of Thylea. However, I want to make a couple additional ones available, in case they appeal. These are sourced from *MoAR Complete*. 

## Cultures
#### Hoplite Legionnaire
Characters raised in a hoplite legionnaire culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.

***Self-Discipline.*** You gain an expertise die on saving throws made to resist being charmed or frightened.

***Phalanx Training.*** You are proficient with javelins, dorata, spears, and shields.

***Phalanx Formation.*** For you and friendly creatures you can see and who can see you within 5 feet × your proficiency bonus, all weapons have the defensive (any) property.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, write, and sign Common, plus one other language.

#### Islander
Characters raised in the islander culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.

***Climate Adjusted.*** You are acclimated to the extreme weather common to your home. Choose one:
- Arctic: You gain an expertise die saving throws against cold, wind, and water spells and similar
effects.
- Tropical: You gain an expertise die saving throws against fire, radiant, and water spells and similar effects.

***Diver.*** Double the length of time you can hold your breath. (You can hold your breath a number of minutes equal to twice your Constitution modifier, minimum of 1, unless you double the benefits of another trait.)

***Frugal Cooking.*** So long as you are near the ocean, as part of a long rest, you can opt to do the cooking for yourself and up to 5 other creatures. The total amount of Supply consumed by these creatures is halved.

***Islander Weapon Training.*** You are proficient with javelins, nets, spears, and tridents.

***Seafarer.*** You are proficient with water vehicles. You are also proficient with either navigator’s tools, sewing kit, or woodcutter's tools.

***Island’s Blessing.*** You carry with you some of your island’s magic, even if you don’t realize it. You know one druid cantrip of your choice. The spellcasting ability of this spell is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.

***Through Wind and Rain.*** You ignore difficult terrain caused by conditions of intense wind or rain. When you are subject to forced movement caused by air or water effects, you halve that distance.
***Languages.*** You can speak, read, write, and sign Common, plus one other.

## Backgrounds

#### Amnesiac
You have lost your memory. Almost all hints as to who you might have once been are now gone—except for your memento and that one person who seems to recognize you. Profound memory loss such as yours is almost always associated with trauma—and magical in nature. Brain damage and mental illness certainly can attack the identity, but they are associated with other profound setbacks such as the loss of speech, loss of motor coordination, and anterograde memory loss (memories after the incident are lost—not before like in your case). You find your capabilities oddly intact, and the faintest memories eke back to you as you deploy skills which your body remembers but your mind has forgotten.

***Ability Score Increases:*** +1 to any two different ability scores. (Roll a d6 to choose randomly if you'd like.)

***Skill Proficiencies:*** Any two; choose or roll randomly.

***Tool Proficiencies:*** Any two; choose or roll randomly.

***Suggested Equipment (Cost 7 gold):*** Traveler’s clothes, healer’s satchel (10 uses)

***Feature: Memory Surge.*** Whenever you gain inspiration, you gain an expertise die which you can use on one d20 roll before your next long rest.
