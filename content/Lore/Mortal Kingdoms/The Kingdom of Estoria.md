Estoria is an ancient stronghold that has resisted centuries of attacks by centaurs, cyclopes, manticores, and other dangers which thrive on the steppes beyond the Arkelon River. The king of Estoria is [[Pythor]], the mightiest of the Five Gods. He rules from his palace at the highest vantage point in the city.  
  
From his throne, Pythor can survey the sprawling farmlands of his kingdom to the south and watch vigilantly for any new threats that might emerge from the north. Although the Estorians are considered provincials by the people of Mytros, everyone knows that the greatest warriors and adventurers of this age are forged in the service of the Lord of Battle.
