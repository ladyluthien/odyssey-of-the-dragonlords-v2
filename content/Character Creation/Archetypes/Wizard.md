### Academy Philosopher
Academy philosophers are great thinkers who do not specialize in any particular spell school, but rather spend their time analyzing the nature of reality and applying that learning to their magic. They usually spend many years studying at venerable schools where philosophers from many different disciplines gather. They enjoy participating in endless debates and dialogues, and they always seek to score points on those who champion rival schools of thought. 
#### Philosophical School 
Starting at 2nd level, you choose from one of several philosophical schools to specialize in at your academy. This school becomes deeply ingrained in your way of thinking about the world. 
##### School: Cynicism 
Cynics believe that one should reject material desires such as wealth and power. They advocate for an ascetic lifestyle, seeking to increase virtue by achieving harmony with nature. Starting when you choose this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a spell into your spellbook is halved. Additionally, you may spend 10 minutes foraging to locate the material components for any spell, with a total value of 50 gp or less. 
##### School: Eclecticism 
Eclectics believe that no single set of doctrines can be all-encompassing. They adapt the ideas of multiple philosophical schools by choosing what they think is most reasonable. Starting when you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn an additional language of your choice. Starting at 5th level, choose another philosophical school. You gain one of the abilities of that school. If you select the Epicureanism school, you may use the ability once. If you select the Stoicism or Hedonism school, you may only use it on a long rest.
##### School: Empiricism 
Empiricists believe that the world must be observed to be understood, and that the goal of philosophy is to understand why things are as they are. Starting when you choose this school at 2nd level, you become proficient in the Perception skill. Additionally, you may cast the *identify* or *detect magic* spell once with this trait (without using a spell slot), and you regain the ability to do so after completing a short or long rest. 
##### School: Epicureanism 
Epicureans believe that the world is ruled by chance and that appealing to the gods is useless vanity. They believe that happiness is achieved by minimizing pain and living simple lives. Starting when you choose this school at 2nd level, when a creature you can see attacks you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, and it recharges when you complete a short or long rest. 
##### School: Stoicism 
Stoics believe that we must develop self-control and fortitude in order to overcome our own self-destructive emotions. They advocate for humility and faith as antidotes to suffering. Starting when you choose this school at 2nd level, whenever you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points or less, you may spend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to be reduced to 1 hit point instead. Once you have used this feature, you may not use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
##### School: Sophism 
Sophists specialize in developing rhetorical and aesthetic powers, and they advocate for principles of excellence and virtue in all endeavors. Starting when you choose this school at 2nd level, you become proficient in the Persuasion skill and double your proficiency bonus when using that skill. Additionally, you gain the *friends* cantrip. 
##### School: Hedonism 
Hedonists believe that pleasure is the supreme good, and that everyone should seek to achieve the immediate gratification of their desires. Starting when you choose this school at 2nd level, when you regain hit points from a spell or ability, you may choose to add twice your wizard level to the number of hit points restored. Once you have used this feature, you may not use it again until you complete a short or long rest. 
##### School: Skepticism 
Skeptics believe that to truly possess knowledge of things is impossible. They believe that there are universal truths, but they cannot be understood well enough to shape dogmatic ideas about the world. Starting when you choose this school at 2nd level, you have advantage on ability checks to detect visual illusions and on saving throws against effects imposed by them. You also have advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that would charm you. 
#### Mathematical Principles 
Starting at 6th level, you have spent years solving complex mathematical equations, allowing you to shape your spells with precision and create pockets of safety for allies. When you cast a spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you may choose a number of them equal to your Intelligence modifier. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save. Additionally, when you cast a spell that has an area of effect radius, you may choose to increase or decrease the radius by 5 feet. 
#### Metaphysical Principles 
Starting at 10th level, you gain new insights into the nature of causality. Whenever a creature casts a spell with a single target that you can see, you can use your reaction to choose a new target for the spell. The new target must be legal for that spell. Once you have used this feature, you may not use it again until you complete a short or long rest. 
#### Magical Paradox 
Starting at 14th level, youâ€™ve spent years studying philosophical paradoxes, which allows you to work seemingly impossible feats with magic. Whenever you would lose concentration on a spell for any reason, you may choose to maintain concentration instead, as long as you are not incapacitated. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, and you regain any expended uses after a long rest.
