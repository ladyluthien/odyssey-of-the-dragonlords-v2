***Note.*** This campaign is written to go to from 1 to 15 and could very easily go to 20. If you wish to make your previous self higher than level 11, that's totally fine. 

Optionally, you can choose the epic path below. If you do so, you gain inspiration when you complete your Heroic Tasks, *even if you had inspiration already*. This is the only way to have two inspiration at a time. Rather than fulfilling your destiny, you gain the Divine Blessing when you complete your Heroic Tasks, although you can still earn inspiration from your destiny source and spend it using your inspiration source. However, the Epic Path ties you to a very specific story (and this one is a little interesting: you are effectively Odysseus if he had said yes to Circe, or Persephone in the realms of Hades, which means that a potentially uncomfortable unequal power relationship is very much baked into your backstory; we'll chat about how we want to handle those kinds of things at session zero). 
#### Optional: Epic Path

***The Vanished One.***
You are one of the Dragonlords, the legendary outside explorers who first discovered Thylea. You were present when the tiny settlement of Mytros was founded, but you’ve been missing for almost 500 years. During an expedition into the Cerulean Gulf, you fell victim to the charms of a nymph named Versi. You’ve spent the last five centuries in a waking dream, trapped in her cave with no knowledge of time passing or events on the mainland. Versi released her hold on you when you were called by fate to save Thylea, but she made you swear an oath to return to her once your quest is completed. Versi is known as the Oracle by most of the inhabitants of Thylea. 

If you are a birdfolk, merfolk, minotaur, nymph, or satyr, you are not one of the dragonlords. Instead, you were the champion of your people, defeated by the dragonlords. You seek to claim the power of a dragon and rebuild the order to include all peoples of Thylea. 

**Adventure Hook:** You are the Oracle’s favorite pet. 
##### Heroic Tasks 
- To find if you have any descendants. 
- To reclaim your title as a Dragonlord. In order to do this you must: 
	> Attune with one of the crowns of the dragonlords.
	> Find a dragon egg, hatch it and raise the dragon to be your companion. 
- To get back your fabled armor. Choose one item from the following list: 
	> *Boots of Speed*: Emblazoned on the boots is the image of your old dragon mount. 
	> *Dragon scale mail*: Made from the scales, given willingly, of your old dragon mount. 
	> *Cloak of the Bat*: Only you can attune to this cloak. Instead of transforming into a bat, this cloak allows you to transform into a pseudodragon.
	

#### Divine Blessing
When you complete your heroic tasks, you gain the following benefit:

***Blessing of the Dragonlords.*** While mounted on a dragon, you gain that dragon’s damage resistances, damage immunities and senses (blindsight, darkvision and its passive perception if it is greater than yours). If the dragon is an adult or ancient dragon, you can also use its legendary resistance (but this counts towards the total number of uses per day).
