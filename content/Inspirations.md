For fun, here are a collection of things I am drawing inspiration from for this game! I apologize greatly for the amount of long original texts and musical theatre, but also no I don't.
### Emily Wilson's Translation of *The Odyssey*
And *The Iliad*, which I just picked up in beautiful hardcover but have not yet read. Yes, this translation. Wilson is the first woman to translate it and puts it into gloriously simple language (she points out that it's not like old-timey English is any closer to ancient greek than modern english is). Did I mention it's in iambic pentameter?

But Sarah! I'm not going to read all of that! Fine, read [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/magazine/the-first-woman-to-translate-the-odyssey-into-english.html) interview with the translator and it'll give you a sense.
### *Epic: The Musical*
Yes, it's a work-in-progress TikTok sensation. It's somehow still really good. It's on Spotify through the beginning of Act 2. The composer wanted to emulate an anime-style sense of scale and progression and uses synthetic instruments to indicate when the world of the gods is encroaching on the mortal realm and it's overall very cool. 

But Sarah! I'm not going to listen to an entire musical! Fine, watch this [fan-made animatic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skVSbITX4kY), it's like five minutes long and it has Poseidon sinking a bunch of ships. 
### *Hadestown*
Yes, it's another musical. Sorry. Anyway, this one's actually been performed and won a bunch of Tonys. Also on Spotify.

I'm not going to listen to an entire musical, pt. 2: fineeeee. They did a [performance at the Tony's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWtjGIV1sMQ) if you want a song or there's the [Broadway trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWDwy2lAFFo) if you want vibes.

### Anouilh's *Antigone*
This one unapologetically rocks. Originally French, originally performed under Nazi occupation, and as a result very interested in the dynamic between the status quo and revolution. You can read the whole thing here in a [30-page, kind of crusty pdf](https://sfponline.org/Uploads/8/Antigone.pdf)
### Big Love 
Also a play. Okay, I can't say this is like. an actual inspiration, but I teched it in high school and it's so profoundly fucked that I can't claim it's *not* in there, just as a whisper. It's entirely available [online](https://www.charlesmee.org/big-love.shtml) but don't say I didn't warn you. 
### Disney's Hercules
...Do I really need to say it?
