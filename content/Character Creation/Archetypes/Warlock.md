### Sea Witch
Underwater alchemists, worshipers of Mother Ocean, or astrologers who watch the stars reflected on dark waters, sea witches are those whose patrons are aquatic in nature, and whose magic reflects the natural splendor and alien enormity of the ocean. Water is life, and the sea witch claims power over both. They are often blamed for shipwrecks and benthic horrors striding ashore—and such catastrophes are precisely what to expect for those who cross a sea witch.
#### Expanded Spell List
When you choose an archetype, you also choose an expanded spell list your patron grants you access to. Choose one patron expanded spell list, either from here or from in the Core Rulebook. These spells count as warlock spells for you.

##### Expanded Spell Lists
Sea Witches deal with all manner of aquatic patrons— from merfolk demigods, undead pirate lords, or even dread Dagon—and their specialties are water and hunger. Their patrons might also instruct in bewilderment, darkness, psionics, or stars. 

**Water Expanded Spells**
1st | *create or destroy water, fog cloud*

3rd | *gust of wind, sleet storm*

5th | *water breathing, water walk*

7th | *control water, conjure minor elementals (water only)*

9th | *Commune with nature, conjure elemental (water only)*

**Hunger Expanded Spells**
1st | *command, entangle*

3rd | *alter self, mental grip*

5th | *aspect of the moon, bestow curse*

7th | *black tentacles, confusion*

9th | *arcane hand, insect plague* (can appear as quippers or flying fish)

#### Wyrding the Waters
When you take this archetype at 1st level, your induction into the rites of the ocean fills your lungs and suffuses your being with knowledge forbidden to land dwellers. You can breathe both air and water. You gain a swim speed equal to your walking speed; if you already have a swim speed, it instead increases by 10 feet.

If you have a familiar, whenever it follows you into or out of the water it can use its reaction to change its animal form to one suitable for that environment, such as an octopus when entering the water or a cat when leaving the water.

Additionally, choose one of the following:
##### Aquatic Servant
As an action you can conjure your aquatic servant, a water elemental which emerges from a body of water you can see within 30 feet, such as a Tiny-sized puddle or a Large-sized fountain. The aquatic servant takes the form of a beast, the CR of which is no higher than your level divided by 6, and the size of which is no larger than the body of water from which you called it. The servant retains the elemental creature type, and it can appear either as the beast it emulates or as a water
elemental molded into that shape. It takes its turn immediately after yours, and it obeys your mental commands.

You must concentrate on this effect to maintain it, as though concentrating on a spell. The aquatic servant remains in your service for 1 hour, or until you no longer concentrate on this effect.
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you complete a long rest.
##### Drowner’s Curse
You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target dies, you die, or you become incapacitated. The curse has the following effects:
- Choose cold or piercing damage. When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an additional 1d4 damage of the chosen type. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.
- The cursed creature’s speed is reduced by half, and they have disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution checks. 
- They halve the duration they can hold their breath and they double the rate at which they sink.

Once you have used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Smooth Sailing
At 6th level, you gain resistance to your choice of either cold, lightning, or thunder damage. Additionally, whenever a creature you see within 10 feet of your Drowner’s Curse target or within 10 feet of your Aquatic Servant takes damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.
#### Jewel of the Depths
At 10th level, your patron reveals to you a secret long lost to arcanists of the surface world. Choose one spell from the following: *black tentacles, blight, phantasmal killer,* or *tearful
sonnet.* This is a warlock spell for you and does not count against your spells known.
Once between long rests, you can use this feature to cast the chosen spell without spending spell points. Damage can’t break your concentration on this spell.

You also gain one benefit from the following:
- You gain temporary hit points equal to your warlock level.
- You teleport to a location you can see within 60 feet.
- Water falls as rain that extinguishes exposed flames within 60 feet.
- A fog cloud effect comes into being as though cast by you, although it does not require concentration.
#### Living Typhoon
At 14th level, you can open yourself to ocean spirits as a bonus action and surround yourself with a miniature hurricane for 1 minute. In this state you gain the following benefits:
- Violent wind (or current) surrounds you, creating difficult terrain for creatures within 30 feet.\
- You gain a flight speed of 60 feet; your swim speed increases to 60 feet.
- You gain an expertise die on saving throws against spells and other magical abilities. 
- You have immunity to one damage type, chosen from acid, cold, fire, lighting, or thunder. 
- Once on your turn, after you attack or cast a spell, regardless of whether you hit or if the target saved, you can cause one target of that attack or spell to take 2d6 acid, cold, force, lighting, or thunder damage (your choice)
- 
Once you use this feature, you must complete a short or long rest to use it again.

##### New Secret of Arcana: Phantom Schooner
Prerequisite: 13th level, Sea Witch archetype

As an action, you can conjure your phantom schooner into unoccupied space on the surface of water or underwater within 120 feet. Your phantom schooner is a sailing ship, but it is propelled by your will instead of the wind, and it can travel even underwater. Non-aquatic creatures aboard your phantom schooner don’t experience the effects of being underwater, breathing and walking about the ship as though they were above water.

The ship cannot sink and it does not malfunction, although its speed is halved while it is bloodied, and once it is reduced to 0 hit points its speed is reduced to 0. Your phantom schooner regains all its hit points when you complete a long rest (restoring any lost movement). Despite this, all signs of physical damage and wear remain on the ship indelibly.

You can also dismiss your phantom schooner as an action. Once dismissed, your phantom schooner and any unattended objects onboard are shunted to an extradimensional space resembling the Elemental Plane of Water. Food and water stored in this way instantly
spoil, but other objects degrade at their normal rate as though under ocean water. Creatures on your phantom schooner when you dismiss it are not transported; if they are above water they fall harmlessly to the ground or water below. You can conjure and dismiss your phantom schooner at will.

### Undying

#### Life Support
When you take this pact at first level, you gain the *spare the dying* cantrip, which does not count against your cantrips known. You can cast this cantrip as a bonus action. In addition, choose one of the following:
#### Defy Death
When you target a creature with spare the dying, you regain hit points equal to 1d8+your constitution modifier. You can reattach severed body parts when healing in this way. In addition, you gain advantage on saving throws versus poison and disease. 
#### Conjure Death
You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target dies, you die, or you become incapacitated. The curse has the following effects:
- When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an additional 1d4 necrotic damage. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.
- When the creature dies, you regain hit points equal to 1d8 plus your warlock level.
#### Command over the Grave
Starting at 6th level, when you kill a creature targeted by your Conjure Death or under the effects of one of your warlock spells, you can resurrect it as a specter or a shadow (your choice) into an unoccupied space within 30 feet. The creature rolls its own initiative, has its own turns, and obeys your verbal commands. It retains no memory from its life. The creature disappears after 1 minute, when you are knocked unconscious, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.

At 15th level, you can have your patron conjure for you either a skeletal champon or a wight  instead.\

Once you have used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
#### Undying Body
Beginning at 10th level, you can hold your breath indefinitely, and you don't require food, water, or sleep, although you still require rest to reduce exhaustion and still benefit from finishing short and long rests. In addition, your hit point maximum cannot be reduced, and you gain resistance to necrotic damage.

Finally, you age at a slower rate. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year, and you are immune to being magically aged.
#### Defy Death 
At 14th level, you require six death saving throw failures to die instead of three, and you only require two death saving throw successes to become stabilized. In addition, whenever you finish a short or long rest, you gain the benefits of the *death ward* spell, which lasts until the end of your next short or long rest, or until the spell effect is triggered as normal.

### Unnaturalist
https://a5e.tools/node/3786

***Note.*** The levels 10 and 14 features are replaced with the following, since oozes and aberrations are hardly as ancient-Greek-y as a *hydra*:
#### Expanded Monstrous Shape
At 10th level, you learn the shape of monstrosities equal in CR to half your warlock level. If the CR of the monster is greater than 1/3rd your level, you do not add your spellcasting ability modifier to the armor class. 

Additionally, you can now use your Monstrous Shape feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus per short rest without using spell points.

#### Reliably Unnatural
At 14th level, you can use any eldritch invocation while in your Monstrous Shape. If the invocation grants you a specific spell (as opposed to an expanded spell list), you can cast that spell while in Monstrous Shape even if it does not have a range of self or touch. 

In addition, you may cast *dominate monster* as a ritual.
