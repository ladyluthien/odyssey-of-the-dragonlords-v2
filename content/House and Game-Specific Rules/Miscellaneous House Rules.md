A couple of things to familiarize yourself with, if you're not already aware. **Some are specific to this game.**

- I use flanking, so long as you are exactly across the grid. 
- I am *not* using any kind of Injury rules. Epic heroes don't get a sprained ankle. You can still sacrifice shields and negate crits with fatigue per usual.
- You can attune to a number of magic items equal to your proficiency bonus. 
- In this campaign, you can potentially ascend to godhood. If that's of interest to you, let me know.
- If you're familiar with this module already, you'll know that the original treats Thylea kind of like Narnia, where people coming from other worlds is, if not common, certainly something that happens. I'm avoiding that specific piece of lore because it makes the [[Laws of Thylea]] too easy to circumvent e.g. "well I'm not from here so why would these laws apply". You could still be an outsider of some form, but try and keep it in-genre. The campaign will go off the rails fast enough without being driven there.
