Steel has not yet made its way to Thylea. As a result, most weapons and armor are made of bronze, although mithril and adamantine can be worked. Bronze equipment is half again as heavy as regular equipment, and costs 75% of the listed costs. In addition, any armor Strength requirements are increased by 1. 

Bronze cannot be made into chainmail. Sorry. 
#### Cultural Weapons
The labrys and khopesh are available. In addition, Thyleans sometimes use a doru (plural dorata), a large spear with a spike on the end. A pair of these spears symbolizes military might. 

Doru | 75gp | 6lbs | double (club), dual-wielding (doru only), thrown (10/30), parrying | 1d8 slashing/1d4 piercing

***Note.*** Dorata can be dual-wielded with each other or with a single one, using the club rear end as the "off-hand" attack. In antiquity, the rear end was often sharpened (the *sauroter*, literally, lizard killer) but that makes it mechanically goofy in D&D terms, so I'm calling it a club. Just know that they were often actually sharp.
