#### Mytros, The Goddess of Dawn

Mytros, called by some the ‘Silver Queen’ is the most benevolent of the Five Gods and the patron goddess of the most important kingdom in Thylea. She is widely credited with the survival of the city during the destruction and aftermath of the First War, and she is said to appear to her priests as a warrior queen clad in shimmering golden armor. Having ascended to the heavens after a cataclysmic battle with [[Sydon]] and [[Lutheria]], she no longer walks among mortals. She is the most powerful of the Five Gods, and the source of most priestly magic in Thylea.

Her husband is [[Volkan]].
