#### Kentimane, The Hundred Handed  
Kentimane was the most powerful of the Titans. He is believed to be both the husband and eternal guardian of the Great Mother. Many references are found to him in the poetry of the gygans and the centaurs, but few credible sources have survived the ravages of time.  
  
Kentimane is usually depicted with one hundred heads and one hundred hands.
