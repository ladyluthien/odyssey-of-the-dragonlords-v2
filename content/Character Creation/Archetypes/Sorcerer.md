### Songweaver
*(Note: this is inspired by the Gate Pass Gazette archetype, but substantially rewritten to avoid overlap with the stormborn sorcerer and generally streamline its flavor. You probably won't get anything helpful from the tools site version outside of satisfying curiousity).*

Songweavers tap into the innate power of story and epic. Deep scholars of magic say that at its heart, it sings; songweavers call upon that song and infuse it into their spellcasting.
#### Songweaver Archetype Spells
1st level: *bane, dramatic sting, harmonic resonance, heroism*

3rd level: *augury, blur, enhance ability, magic mouth*

5th level: *clairvoyance, hypnotic pattern, sending, tongues* 

7th level: *accelerando, death ward, mindshield, tearful sonnet*

9th level: *awaken, dancing feet, geas, hallow*
#### Operatic Shriek
Also at 1st level, you can manifest magic into your voice. As an action, you can scream, sending a wave of force out from yourself in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 force damage on a failure and half on a success. In addition, creatures who fail the saving throw are deafened and rattled for one minute. The shriek can be heard for 100 feet and does not function in a *silence* field. 

Once you have shrieked, you must rest your voice with a short or long rest before you can do so again. Alternatively, you can spend two sorcery points to use it again.
#### Songflight
At 6th level, your songs literally lift people off their feet. You can use a bonus action and spend 2 sorcery points to grant a creature a fly speed equal to your Speed for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. This feature requires concentration like a spell and does not work in an area affected by the *silence* spell or similar noise-canceling magic.
### Immutable Song
At 14th level, your connection to epic becomes more difficult to resist. When you cast a spell from the sound school of magic, creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against it. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws and checks made to escape being silenced by mundane (e.g. gags) and magical means. 
#### Operatic Serenade
Also at 14th level, your operatic shriek improves. It now deals 4d8 damage and can permeate a *silence* field, although creatures within the *silence* field take half damage on a failure and no damage if they succeed. 
In addition, if a creature fails their save by five or more, they become stunned. 
#### Improved Songflight
At 18th level, the arcana within your soul makes you naturally buoyant and able to grant some of it to others. A number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier you can use your bonus action to spend 5 sorcery points to grant a creature a fly speed equal to twice your Speed and the ability to hover for 1 minute. This feature does not work in an area affected by the *silence* spell or similar noise-canceling magic.

### Stormborn
Stormborn sorcerers are those for whom the thundering, howling, electric power of the storm thrums through their very veins. They can draw about this inner tempest as a source of powerful magic. Some have tempers and personalities as tempestuous as their magic, while others  
are strangely calm and disciplined, having trained  
themselves to live as the eye of the storm.
### Stormborn Archetype Spells
1st level: _air wave, arcane riposte, create or destroy water, thunderwave_  

3rd level: _gust of wind, levitate, shatter, sleet storm_  

5th level: _call lightning, crushing haymaker, whirlwind kick, wind wall_  

7th level: _blight, conjure minor elementals_ (water or air only), _control water, ice storm_ 

9th level: _cone of cold, conjure elemental_ (water or air only), _hold monster, storm kick_
#### Raging Tempest
At 1st level you can spend 1 sorcery point as a bonus action to be carried by the wind, flying 15 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity. If you do so ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage against you until the start of your next turn.

In addition, at 2nd level you must choose the blizzard or hurricane manifestation, and at 12th level you must either improve that manifestation or choose the other one.
#### The Calm Before
At 6th level when you roll initiative you may choose to do so with disadvantage. If you do so, you regain sorcery points equal to half your proficiency bonus. Once you have done so you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
#### Resist Elements
At 14th level you gain an expertise die on Strength and Constitution saving throws. You also gain resistance to your choice of lightning, cold, or thunder damage. You can change the damage type whenever you finish a long rest. If you would take damage of one of the types you are not resistant to, you may spend 2 sorcery points as a reaction to also gain resistance to that damage type until the start of your next turn.
### Ride the Storm
At 18th level you gain a flying speed of 80 feet while outdoors. In addition, if you are outdoors and it is stormy weather, any spell you cast that deals thunder, lightning, or cold damage adds your Charisma modifier to one of its damage rolls.
