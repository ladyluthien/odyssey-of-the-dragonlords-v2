***Note.*** Aasimar are called demigods and have one divine parent and one mortal parent (or, possibly, a more distant ancestor). It's probably wise, as a demigod, to pick the [[Prophecy]] destiny and an Epic Path. When you select this, pick your godly ancestor: [[Mytros]], [[Volkan]], [[Pythor]], [[Kyrah]], or [[Vallus]]. 

Tieflings are called Stygians and are generally assumed to be the child of a Titan, usually [[Lutheria]] but possibly [[Sydon]].
