Your life is already woven into the tapestry of Fate. Choose one of the Epic Paths below. In addition, you gain the following source of inspiration and inspiration feature:

***Source of Inspiration: Recognition.*** Your life was laid out for you before you were born. When you succeed or fail at something without making a dice roll for it, you gain inspiration.

***Inspiration Feature: Preordained Fate.*** Your death is already prophesied; anything that arrives sooner is merely an invigorating taste of what’s to come. When you have 0 hit points at the end of another creature’s turn, you can spend your inspiration to gain 1 hit point. When you do, move your position in initiative to immediately after that creature’s turn, and take your turn normally.

If you want an epic path but a different Destiny, check out [[Revenge]] and [[Return to Glory]], two destinies that synergized really nicely with specific epic paths. 

## Epic Paths

Each epic path comes with recommended magic items and a set of goals, the culmination of which is a Divine Blessing.

### The Cursed One 
You come from a great family or tribe that has been cursed for centuries, owing to the actions of one of your distant ancestors, who angered the Titans. Whatever the nature of your curse, the stigma has haunted you for all your life. Wherever you go, you are shunned by the ignorant and the superstitious. As a result, you have felt like an outsider for all your life. You know that as long as you remain cursed, you will be incapable of living a full life. Moreover, you are not sure that your family or your tribe will survive for another generation unless you find a way to lift the curse. 

***Adventure Hook:*** The Oracle reveals that she knows who can end the curse. 
#### Heroic Tasks
-  To end your family’s curse. 
- To find a family artifact that is key to ending the curse. Pick one lesser and one greater magic item from this list: 
	-  (Lesser) Gem of Brightness: only you can attune. 
	- (Greater) Staff of Fire: can be any melee weapon. 
	- (Greater) Belt of Fire Giant Strength: this belt also grants resistance to fire. 
	- (Greater) Efreeti Bottle: only you can attune. 

#### Divine Blessing 
***Blessing of the Gods.*** You and your direct family are immune to curses, diseases, and the poisoned condition.

### The Demi-God \
You are a mortal child of Pythor, the god of battle. Your temper is legendary. From an early age, you demonstrated unnatural talent in everything that interested you. You’ve never met your father, but your mother was a woman famed for both her beauty and her skill as a harpist. She was carried away by a green dragon when you were very young. A family of soldiers adopted you, and then raised you to be a mighty champion for the city of Mytros (if you are a birdfolk, merfolk, minotaur, or nymph, you are instead a champion of your home community). You are a favorite child of the city, and bards already sing of your great deeds while travelling the Heartlands. As a youth, the Oracle predicted a great destiny, one in which you might be able to join the pantheon alongside your divine father, who has recently fallen into despair and drunkenness. According to the Oracle, Pythor can be brought back from his drunken oblivion if you are able to achieve the three great labors that defeated him. You must find Pythor’s last great love (your mother), defeat his greatest foe, and finish building his greatest weapon. Do these tasks, and your father will be redeemed. 

***Adventure Hook:*** You have been summoned by the Oracle due to your fame and divine heritage. 

#### Heroic Tasks 
- Find your mother (Ophea or a name created by you). 
- Defeat Pythor’s greatest foe. According to legend this is a green dragon known as Hexia. 
- Finish building Pythor’s greatest weapon. Choose either: 
	- Rod of Lordly Might; or 
	- Luck Blade (can be any type of sword) 

#### Divine Blessing 
***Blessing of Health.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.

### The Doomed One
You come from a famous and distinguished family with ancestors that include Dragonlords (if you are dwarf, elf, gnome, halfling, or human) or Titans (birdfolk, merfolk, minotaur, nymph, satyr). However, you had the misfortune of being born under a fell astrological sign, one that portended a doom of epic proportions. Your parents died shortly after you were born, under mysterious circumstances. All your life you have been plagued by ill luck, and you have long suspected that your death will be as ugly as it is spectacular. The prophets and fortune tellers of Mytros make signs against evil when they see you in the street, and you have always been treated with prejudice and superstitious dread. Nevertheless, you’ve been called by fate to the Temple of the Oracle, and this can only mean that your nameless doom is now at hand. The Oracle has promised that your doom can be avoided, for she alone knows what will protect you.

***Adventure Hook:*** The Oracle knows that your doom reflects the doom of the world. If you save yourself, you will be able to save the world. 

#### Heroic Tasks 
- To defeat the creature that has been fated to kill you. 
- To forge the one artifact that will protect you from your doom. These items provide resistance to all damage that originates from the creature that is fated to kill you. Choose one from the following list: 
	- Robe of the Archmagi 
	- Breastplate of Invulnerability 
	- cloak of Invisibility 

#### Divine Blessing 
***Blessing of Protection.*** You gain a +1 bonus to your AC and to all saving throws. 

### The Gifted One 
Ever since you were a child you’ve shown remarkable promise, effortlessly mastering every activity you’ve attempted. You have no explanation, but most people assume that you must have divine blood flowing through your veins. As you are from a common, or barbarian, family, you have been the target of seething envy from the children of the nobility and the wealthy who believe you do not deserve your gifts. You’ve therefore spent most of your life proving your worth. You want to achieve fame and fortune and have your name remembered down the ages. Mostly… you want to become a Dragonlord. If you could find a dragon egg and successfully hatch it, you could join the list of legendary heroes that are still remembered after five centuries. The call of the Oracle has given you an opportunity to prove your worth. 

***Adventure Hook:*** The Oracle promises that the prophecy will put you on the path to become a Dragonlord. 

#### Heroic Tasks 
- To found a new order of Dragonlords. To do so you must find the Fortress of the Dragonlords. 
- To attune with one of the crowns of the dragonlords.  
- To find a dragon egg, hatch it and raise the dragon to be your companion. 

#### Divine Blessing 
***Blessing of the Dragonlords.*** While mounted on a dragon, you gain that dragon’s damage resistances, damage immunities and senses (blindsight, darkvision and its passive perception if it is greater than yours). If the dragon is an adult or ancient dragon, you can also use its legendary resistance (but this counts towards the total number of uses per day).  

### The Haunted One 
You were once in possession of the rarest treasure in Thylea: a truly happy life. You had a loving partner, beautiful children, and lived in a great house in the city of Mytros. As the first child of a powerful family with godly lineage, you were destined to be the next ruler of Mytros. Then one day, everything changed. You returned home to find your house cold and empty. Your friends and neighbors have no memory of your family, almost as if they never existed. For a while, you struggled against insanity. Now you’ve resolved to find your family, whatever the cost. You’ll travel to the ends of the earth and fight the gods themselves if needed. You’ll do whatever it takes to bring back the people you love, even if everyone thinks you’re crazy. 

****Adventure Hook:**** The Oracle claims that saving the world and fulfilling the prophecy will give you answers about your family’s disappearance. 

### Heroic Tasks
- To be reunited with your family. 
- To reclaim your family name and legacy by tracking down your family artifacts. Pick one lesser and one greater family artifact from this list: 
	- (Lesser) Ring of Protection: this signet ring was worn by members of your lost family. 
	- (Lesser) Amulet of Health: this amulet is emblazoned with your family crest. 
	- (Lesser) Ioun Stone, Awareness: this stone was a jewel given to your ancestors by the gods. 
	- (Greater) Helm of Brilliance: this crown was worn by your ancestors, who were past rulers of Mytros. 
	- (Greater) Dancing Sword: this sword (it can be of any type) contains the soul of the family’s founder. 
	- (Greater) Rod of Absorption: this rod was always carried by the leader of your family. 

#### Divine Blessing 
***Blessing of Magic Resistance.*** You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
