### Oracle
Oracles pay special attention to dreams, intuitive thoughts, and hallucinatory visions. They are widely believed to be capable of predicting the future, though their visions are often misinterpreted. They live by the phrase, “know thyself.” Oracles often carry special varieties of incense and holy water with them. The holy water may be boiled to produce vapors, which the oracle inhales in order to enter a trance-like state. During such a trance, the oracle thrashes and wails as they experience flashes of divine insight. They often employ scribes to write down their words, so that they may be recalled later. 
#### Prophecy Domain Spells 
- 1st Level: *detect magic, identify*
- 3rd Level: *augury, locate object*
- 5th Level: *beacon of hope, clairvoyance*
- 7th Level: *death ward, divination* 
- 9th Level: *dream, scrying*
#### Mindful Senses 
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the *message* cantrip if you don’t already know it. Additionally, you gain proficiency in the Perception skill. If you already have proficiency, you gain an expertise die. 
#### Blessing of Foresight 
Starting at 1st level, you use your divination spells to protect your allies from future events. Whenever you cast a divination spell of 1st level or higher, choose one creature you can see. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level. 
#### Channel Divinity: Prophetic Trance 
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to enter a prophetic trance. As an action, you inhale hallucinatory vapors and enter a trance-like state for 10 minutes. Roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these prophecy rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll is made. Each prophecy roll can be used only once. You lose the prophecy rolls when your trance ends. 
#### Visions of Danger 
Starting at 6th level, you experience flashes of foresight that reveal to you when your allies will be harmed, allowing you to react with uncanny speed. When you ready a spell that restores hit points, it does not require or break concentration. Additionally, when one of your allies takes damage or fails a saving throw, you may use your reaction to move up to your speed and cast a beneficial spell that only targets your imperiled ally. The casting time of the spell must be a reaction, action, or bonus action. You may use this feature twice, and you regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. 
#### Healing Vapors 
Starting at 8th level, your healing spells are accompanied by a mist of restorative vapors. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier. 
Additionally, when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points, you may choose to add the effect of *fog cloud* at the location of one of your targets. You must complete a long rest before you can create another fog cloud with this feature. 
#### Perfect Foresight 
Starting at 17th level, your prophetic powers are nearly infallible. When you enter a prophetic trance with Channel Divinity, you may choose to replace the result of one d20 prophecy roll with any number between 1 and 19 of your choice. Additionally, while you are in the trance, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, and you can see invisible creatures and objectives within 10 feet of you that are within line of sight.

### Undertaker
Undertakers are clerics charged with guiding the living into the dark—be that gently or with the gnashing of teeth. Some undertakers worship the gods of death and destruction, uttering curses of decay and raising armies of undead. Others worship gods who—out of a respect for the dignity of life or hatred for the undead—practice death magics as a way to balance the cosmic scales. One way or another, they find themselves dealing with the rivers of life and death, either wading through or gliding gently across. Holding fate so clearly in their hands, some undertakers
more closely identify their archetype with another term: psychopomp, or “guide of souls.” Such an undertaker directly identifies with the spirits who transition mortal souls into the afterlife, such as angels of death, valkyries, chain devils—or even Charon, the Ferry of the River Styx.

***Table: Undertaker Spells***
1st level | *detect poison and disease, protection from evil and good*
3rd level | *gentle repose, ray of enfeeblement*
5th level | *animate dead, revivify*
7th level | *blight, death ward*
9th level | *antilife shell, raise dead*
#### Undertaker’s Senses
Starting at 1st level when you choose this archetype, you can cast *detect evil and good* without spending spell slots. You can do so a total number of times between long rests equal to your Wisdom modifier. When you cast *detect evil and good*, you know whether an entity you sense is Undead.
#### Witness to the End
Also at 1st level, you are charged with transitioning those whose time has come. You gain proficiency with martial weapons. You learn *chill touch* and *spare the dying* as bonus cantrips. Once between long rests, when you cast *ceremony* to perform a funeral or to guide the passing, you can do so without providing material components.
#### Channel Divinity: Moribund Curse
Beginning at 2nd level, as a bonus action you can lay a curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. The next time that creature is hit by an attack before the end of your next turn, that attack’s total damage is doubled.
#### Grave Guardian
At 6th level, choose one option from the following:
##### Displaced Death
Through intensive prayer or symbolic rites, you can divert ill fates. When you or a friendly creature within 30 feet fails a death saving throw, you can use this feature to strike that failure from the record (even if you are unconscious). Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.\
##### Piercing Darkness
Necrotic damage you deal ignores resistance. When you reach 12th level, you treat creatures which
ordinarily have immunity to necrotic damage as only having resistance. At 18th level, you ignore immunity to necrotic damage.
#### Boon of Fury
Beginning at 8th level, your weapon attacks deal extra damage equal to your Wisdom modifier. In addition, you can infuse divine power into a weapon attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic or radiant damage (your choice when you gain this feature). Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
#### Tides of Styx
Beginning at 17th level, you can twist ambient life force emitted by the dying to the benefit of your allies… or to yourself alone. When a creature you can see of CR 1 or higher dies within 120 feet of you, you or a friendly creature you can see within that range regains hit points equal to 1d6 per that creature’s CR (minimum of 1d6). (Creatures who use character level instead of CR are
treated as having CR equal to their level.)
