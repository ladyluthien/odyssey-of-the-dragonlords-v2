### Poet
Poets are devoted to the creation of a singular epic. All the greatest stories in history were originally captured and recreated for audiences as masterful works of poetry. These stories were passed down for centuries in an oral tradition, and eventually, they were recorded on papyrus scrolls and stored in great libraries.Those who wish to record their own epic poems spend their early years studying philosophy, aesthetics, and music, so that they have the necessary language 
to capture the splendor of great deeds. However, an epic poet cannot spend all their life in the Academy. Eventually, they must seek out great conflicts, for great conflicts produce great heroes, and great heroes produce great deeds. As such, you have prepared yourself for a life of turmoil, chasing after warriors who brave impossible odds. You have learned to transcribe events faithfully, even  in the chaos of battle. You know that if your quill slips at a pivotal moment, the beauty of that instant may be forever lost to history.
#### Epic Verses
At 3rd level, you begin composing your epic poem. When certain significant events occur during your travels or during combat, you may use your reaction to compose a new epic verse. Significant events are defined as any of the following things happening to you or one of your allies by chance (e.g. your party cannot deliberately force them to happen by repetition). You must be able to see 
or hear the event happen.
- Comedy: Someone rolls a natural 1 on an attack or saving throw.
- Hubris: Someone rolls a natural 20 on an attack or saving throw.
- Irony: Someone fails a saving throw after adding a Bardic Inspiration die.
- Tragedy: Someone is reduced to zero hit points by an enemy.
- 
Additionally, any particularly exciting event that seems to warrant inclusion in your poem is eligible as long as the Narrator approves—but don’t push it.

Each time you compose a new epic verse, you must declare that you are doing so. If the GM approves, then you may add 1 verse to your poem. You may also want to write down what happened and why, so that you can enjoy reading it later, but this is not required. Your poem increases in rank as the number of verses grows.
##### Verse Counts & Party Size
These verse counts are based on a party size of six. If you have less than six members in your party, then the required verse counts are reduced. Multiply your party size by the poem rank to determine the required verse count. For example, if you have 3 party members, then your required verse count for rank 6 is equal to 18 (3 x 6). 

**Epic Poem Ranks and Effects**
Rank 1 | 6 verses | Minimum Bardic Inspiration = 2
2 | 12 verses | Epic Courage
3 | 18 verses | Minimum Bardic Inspiration = 3
4 | 24 verses | Epic Foresight
5 | 30 verses | Minimum Bardic Inspiration = 4
6 | 36 verses | Epic Determination
7 | 42 verses | Minimum Bardic Inspiration = 5
8 | 48 verses | Epic Reflexes
9 | 54 verses | Minimum Bardic Inspiration = 6
10 | 60 verses | Epic Resistance
#### Inspirational Verses
Starting at 3rd level, when you give someone Bardic Inspiration, you recite a portion of your epic poem, which improves the effect of the dice based upon the rank of your poem.

***Improved Rolls.*** Your Bardic Inspiration dice have a  minimum result value based on the number of verses that you’ve collected. Whenever someone rolls one of  your Bardic Inspiration dice, if they roll less than the minimum value for your poem rank, then the result is equal to the minimum value as determined by your poem rank.

***Additional Effects.*** Your Bardic Inspiration dice have additional effects based on the number of verses that you’ve collected. When you give someone Bardic Inspiration, choose one of the following effects that you have unlocked. They gain the benefit of this effect as long as they have your Bardic Inspiration die. The effect is lost when they roll the die.  
- Epic Courage: You gain an expertise die on saving throws against effects that would frighten you. 
- Epic Determination: You gain an expertise die on death saving throws. 
- Epic Foresight: You cannot be surprised, and you gain an expertise die in Perception.
- Epic Reflexes: You gain an expertise die on saving throws against spells that affect multiple targets. 
- Epic Resistance: You gain resistance to one damage type (Bard’s choice). 
#### Armored Poet 
Starting at 6th level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, so that you can get close to the fighting while composing your poem. Additionally, if you are within 5 feet of an ally when you compose an epic verse about them, then you regain one expended Bardic Inspiration die. 
#### Protective Epithets 
Starting at 14th level, the lyrical epithets that you've selected for your allies take on magical properties, protecting them from death. Whenever a character with your Bardic Inspiration die would be reduced to 0 hit points, they may choose to roll their Bardic Inspiration die and be reduced to that number of hit points instead. The Bardic Inspiration die is then lost.

### Ollave
There are some bards that revel in irresponsibility and see life as one huge, hedonistic party. You’re not one of those. You have a role somewhere between “priest” and “historian” and act as a caretaker of the important cultural memories and tales of your society. You may still enjoy a good wild party now and then, but achieving this level of training requires a serious investment of time and some harrowing tests, and it is unlikely you want to treat all of that effort and hardship casually. 
#### Bonus Proficiencies and Spells 
When you select this archetype at level 3, you gain proficiency with the History, Culture, and Religion skills. If you are already proficient in any of these skills, you gain an expertise die to any that apply. You also learn the *shillelagh* cantrip and the *ceremony* spell. Both count as Bard spells for you, but neither counts against your cantrips or spells known. 
#### Eyes of the Knower 
Also at 3rd level, you are continually under the effect of the *comprehend languages* spell. This is a magical effect and can be suppressed if you are in an antimagic field or similar effect, but it reactivates with no action required on your part as soon as you are outside the area of the suppressing effect. In addition all spells from the knowledge school are added to the bard list for you, and you may select from them when learning a new bard spell. 
#### Historical Link 
At 6th level, your study into the old tales has turned up some useful tricks. You learn an additional battle hymn of a level that you could normally perform. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you may exchange this battle hymn for a different one of a level you could normally perform. 
#### Universal Memory 
At 14th level, you learn to tap into the collective memories of all the mortals on the plane you occupy. As an action, you may do one of the following: 
- Gain proficiency with a skill of your choice. 
- Learn a new spell you qualify to learn. 
- Gain proficiency with two weapons of your choice. 
- Gain proficiency with a saving throw of your choice that you are not already proficient in. 
- Gain proficiency with up a musical instrument or tool set of your choice. 

The new knowledge persists until you use this ability again or until you begin a long rest. Once you have used this ability a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once), you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
