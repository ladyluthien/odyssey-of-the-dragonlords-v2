Merfolk are also sometimes known as sirens, named as such by superstitious (and usually horny) sailors. In truth, the ones that occupy the deepest oceans usually want little to do with the land-dwelling peoples. Many land-dwellers find merfolk voices appealing - their bubbling cadence calls to mind a running stream - and many merfolk find land-dwellers too rough and coarse in voice. However, those who live near the coast are curious nonetheless, and some have learned a shapechanging magic that allows them to walk on land, in appearance similar to a sea elf albeit with uncanny, solid-colored eyes.
