## Destiny: Homegoing

Adventure has called to you for some powerful reason or another. A threat has emerged; a task needs doing; a war brews. Whatever the reason, you will adventure, but you do so reluctantly, and you're always dreaming of the hearth that awaits you when you return. Those with the Homegoing destiny pursue their goals all the more fervently because they know what will be lost if they fail. When you select this destiny, spend some time thinking about what your home looks like. It could be a building, a city, a forest, or even a person. Communicate with your Narrator whether or not you wish this home to be imperiled - and to what degree - to ensure that you both have the same expectations.
#### Source of Inspiration: Departure
No matter how much you love your home, you must leave it to accomplish your goals. You gain inspiration when you have an opportunity to go home that would leave your tasks unfinished and you refuse it.
#### Inspiration Feature: Comfort
Even when you are away from your home, your love for it reassures people. You can spend your inspiration during a short rest to remove one level of strife from a companion or NPC.
### Fulfilling your Destiny
You fulfill your destiny when you return home, or when you accept that you can never return.  

_Come back to your home; learn that your home has been destroyed; make a home somewhere else or with someone else._
#### Fulfillment Feature: Unshakeable
Your adventures and your return have given you a quiet kind of confidence that extends to others in your presence. You are the wise one that people come to with problems; you are the courageous one that people look to when danger threatens. You may give others inspiration a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.
