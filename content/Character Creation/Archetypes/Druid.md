***Note.*** The flavor of this is dope, but it's a little too powerful. As a result, you do not regain the use of Wild Shape as written for the second level feature, and the 14th level feature is replaced with the following:

*At 14th level, if you revert from swarm form to your normal form before one minute has passed, you regain that use of wildshape. In addition, you can pick two of the listed benefits for your swarm, and you become able to cast spells with a range of Touch or Self while a swarm.*
### Elder
Elders are a special breed among druids in that their role is much more similar to that of the priest of an organized religion than is the norm for druids. Indeed, in some cases, an Elder may be part of a religion that trains its leadership as druids rather than clerics; this is especially common with certain nature-oriented or elemental deities. But Elders are more than just religious leaders, they are mysterious messengers and guides, and their training also grants them substantial expertise in uncovering or creating more potent versions of druidic spells. 
#### Natural Theology 
At 2nd level, you receive training in the spiritual aspects of your druidic tradition. You learn the *thaumaturgy* cantrip and it does not count against your cantrips known. The *bless* spell is added to the druid spell list for you, and you gain proficiency with the Religion and Insight skills. Leyline Siphon Also at 2nd level, you can recover some magical energy by tapping into leylines. While in natural surroundings, during a short rest you may recover spell slots of a total level less than or equal to half your druid level (rounded down), none of which may be higher than 5th level. Once you have used this ability, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. 
#### Magical Understanding 
At 6th level, you become significantly better at uncovering obscure druidic magic. When you perform the Spellcraft activity during downtime, you gain an expertise die on the roll and the time and materials costs are reduced by 25%. 
#### Mystical Insight 
Also at 6th level, you have the sort of supernatural awareness more commonly associated with followers of organized religions. Choose one from the Ancestral Guidance, Numinous Awareness, Premonition, or Supernal Intuition Signs of Faith from the cleric class and one from the Do Without, Naturalist, Seek Truth or Sense Import Divine Lessons from the herald class. 
#### Blackwing Messenger 
At 10th level, you gain the ability to wild shape into a special raven form that does not count against your wild shapes known. This special form has a few advantages over a normal raven form:
- You can speak either in your normal voice or a raven’s squawking voice as you see fit. You also can communicate telepathically within 100 feet. 
- While you are in raven form, you may cast the *dream* spell once. This locks you into your raven form until the spell ends, and you must be the messenger. You appear to the target as your raven form, but you may choose to have the target know your identity if you wish. 
- Your flight speed is 120 feet rather than the normal 50- foot speed of a raven. 
- Instead of a raven’s normal beak attack, you have an improved one. Your to-hit modifier is the sum of your Wisdom bonus and Proficiency bonus, and the attack deals 1d4 piercing + your choice of radiant or necrotic damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier. 

If raven was already one of your wild shape forms, you may select another one to replace it when you gain access to this feature. 
#### Sacred Space 
At 14th level, you create or are entrusted with the stewardship of a sacred space. You gain a single grade 3 stronghold of average quality which must be of the Menagerie, Sacred Grove, or Temple type for free. You are unable to sell this special stronghold. You also gain a single seasoned follower of the Apothecary, Cook, Diviner, Healer, or Sage type to assist you and act as the sacred site’s steward while you are away. At the Narrator’s discretion, this stronghold may occupy some exotic location. You gain an expertise die to Nature checks made while occupying this stronghold.

### Sacrificial Ritemaster

All druids understand that life and death are both a part of the balance of the natural order, and  they all have a respect for the power of the elements. But some take this further, adamantly holding to the belief that new life can only come when fed with death, that every blessing has a price. Such druids are keepers of ancient rituals and rites of sacrifice, drawing on death to heal and empower their allies. They are uniquely suited to mastery of the cleansing power of fire, and in some places are known as Wicker druids after a particularly noteworthy ritual.

It should be noted that while these druids have a perhaps deserved sinister reputation, they are not all monsters who capture and sacrifice unsuspecting victims. Some limit themselves only to the sacrificing of non-sentient life, while others are natural avengers who seek out those who have
harmed the natural world or their communities, bringing them to justice while ensuring their deaths do the good their lives did not.
#### Sacrificial Rites
When you select this archetype at 2nd level, you can use a bonus action to mark a creature for sacrifice. Once on your turn when you deal damage to this creature, it takes additional fire damage equal to your Wisdom modifier. When it dies, if the creature had a CR no lower than half your level,
you gain a Burning Boon charge. You can only have a number of Burning Boon charges at a time equal to your proficiency bonus. You can expend a Burning Boon charge as an action to cast the *bless* spell at 1st level without expending a spell slot, and can expend additional charges to increase the effective spell slot level of *bless* by 1 per charge. You can only mark a creature in this way once per short rest, and lose any Burning Boon charges when you finish a long rest.
#### Life and Death
At 6th level, whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points you gain a death die. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals damage, you gain
a life die. Both of these dice start as d4s, and if you cast the appropriate type of spell while you already have one its size increases by one step, to a maximum of a d12. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points you can spend your life die to roll it and add it to one healing roll for the spell. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals damage you can spend your death die to roll it and add it to one damage roll for the spell.
#### Regular Sacrifice
At 10th level you can expend a use of wildshape to mark a creature for sacrifice, in addition to your normal uses.
#### Ultimate Sacrifice
At 14th level, you can expend 5 Burning Boon charges to cast the *resurrection* spell, no material component required. You can only cast *resurrection* on a particular creature once in this way. You also do not need to concentrate on a *bless* spell cast using Burning Boon charges.

You also gain the *flame strike* spell, it is always prepared, and it does not count against the number of spells you have prepared.
